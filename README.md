# machine_learning_basics_tutorial
This repo contains basic tutorials for machine learning.

In this basics tutorials we are going to see what machine learning is using a toy example.
We will also see, what does training a model mean and how learning exactly happens.

So just as to start with this tutorial, let us consider a toy dataset.  
In machine learning world, you have often come across terms like dataset, annotations, training data etc.  
Any learning mechanism is either supervised or unsupervised. It's exatly same as **School Learning vs Self Learning**.  
In this tutorial, we have a dataset where we have sentences and for each sentence we have their corresponding class label.
